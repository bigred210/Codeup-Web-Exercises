				<h1>Hello from CodeUp!</h1>
			</p>

				<!--You dont see me -->	

			<p>
				<span>Hey there</span>, I am Jerod.<br>I am from San Antonio, born and raised. <em>I have a very beautiful and loving wife along with two wonderful children.</em> My eldest child is Aedan, he is eight years old. My youngest is Alaina, she is a mere 8 months and already has her daddy wrapped around her finger. I love to cook from scratch (bbq, bake, broil, fry), and I enjoy teaching myself new things. I play guitar for my Grandmother's parish on Sunday and help out others when possible. I'm a big teddy bear I've been told.

				My wife <strong>Lori and I</strong> love to travel as much as possible, most recently we took a spontaneous anniversary trip. We went to the Taos Ski Vally with our children to celebrate 12 years together (5th Wedding Anniversary). We own a time share in Las Vegas, and try to visit as many other places as possible. Though we don't have a favorite place we do however, enjoy traveling the most as a family.
